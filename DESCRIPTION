Description: Based on the meta-regression model framework, we develop an environment-adjusted meta-regression of GWAS, making use of summary statistics from each cohort, together with cohort-specific environmental exposure information. This will allow us to identify genetic variants that are associated with each trait, across cohorts, while adjusting for differing environmental exposures between cohorts.
